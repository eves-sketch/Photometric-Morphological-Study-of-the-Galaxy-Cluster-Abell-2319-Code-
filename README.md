# Photometric-Morphological-Study-of-the-Galaxy-Cluster-Abell-2319-Code-

This project performs a photometric and morphological study of the galaxy cluster **Abell 2319** using imaging data. The code processes galaxy images to extract photometric properties, including luminosity and surface brightness, and morphological features such as galaxy shape and structural classification.

The goal of this study is to analyze the relationship between galaxy morphology and environment within a dense galaxy cluster. The repository includes data processing scripts, analysis notebooks, and visualization tools used in the study.
